Maze Generator and Solver in Java :

This project is a graphical Maze Generator and Solver using Java's Swing framework. It generates random mazes using recursive backtracking and solves them using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The graphical interface allows users to visualize the maze creation and solving process.

Key Features:
Maze Generation:

The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm that randomly carves out paths in a grid.
Maze Solving:

The maze is solved using BFS, ensuring the shortest path is found from the start to the end of the maze.
Graphical Interface:

The GUI, built with Java Swing, allows users to see the maze and its solution visually.
The interface supports keyboard input:
Press SPACE to solve the maze.
Press R to reset and generate a new maze.
Path Visualization:

The solution path is highlighted, showing users the correct route through the maze.
Use Case:
This project is perfect for learning about maze generation algorithms and visualizing how a search algorithm can find the shortest path in a grid.
